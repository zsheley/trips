## Zachery Sheley

Welcome to my train adventure! Currently, I am still in the planning process of this trip. Come back this summer to see all the excitement!

### Notes:

- I have a budget of roughly $7,000 USD.
- I am hoping to spread this trip out over a span of 2-3 months.
- I'll be travelling solo as of right now.
- Aside from the occasional taxi I plan to rollerblade when between destinations when possible.
